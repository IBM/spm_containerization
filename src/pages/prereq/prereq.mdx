**Ready to jump right in?**

Please note that the preceding section provides an introduction to the architecture of Merative Social Program Management (SPM) on Kubernetes and to concepts you will encounter throughout the rest of the runbook.
If you have already read through the [Architecture](/architecture/kubernetes/spm-on-kubernetes-101) section please continue.
If not, it's the place to start.

</InlineNotification>

SPM was enhanced in version 7.0.10.0 to enable it to be deployed on cloud native hosting platforms.

Further enhancements have been introduced in version 7.0.11.0 to enable deployment on OpenShift.

To build and run Merative Social Program Management (SPM) for Kubernetes, install the following software components:

* [Base third-party software](/prereq/3rdparty-sw)
* [Merative Social Program Management (SPM) software](/deploy-spm/install-spm)
* [Docker®, and Helm](/prereq/docker-helm)
* [Kubernetes](/prereq/kubernetes/kubernetes-overview)
  * [minikube](/prereq/kubernetes/minikube)
* [OpenShift](/prereq/openshift/openshift-overview)
  * [CodeReady Containers](/prereq/openshift/codeready-containers)
* [Code Ready Container](/prereq/openshift/codeready-containers)
* [ChartMuseum](/prereq/chartmuseum)
* [GitHub repo](/prereq/git)

In order to be hosted on Kubernetes, Merative Social Program Management has been enhanced to support the following technologies:

<InlineNotification>

**Note:** These technologies cannot be used independently from each other for Merative Social Program Management on a Kubernetes-based architecture.
Merative Social Program Management will update the supported versions of these technologies frequently throughout the year.
The technologies listed are fixed version support only, unless stated otherwise.
