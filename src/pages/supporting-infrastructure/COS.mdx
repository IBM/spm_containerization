### What is Object Storage?

Object Storage makes it possible to store practically limitless amounts of data, simply and cost effectively.
It is commonly used for data archiving and backup; for web and mobile applications; and as scalable, persistent storage for analytics.
Flexible storage class tiers with a policy-based archive let you effectively manage costs while meeting data access needs.

For more information about Object Storage, see [Object Storage](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Object/Concepts/objectstorageoverview.htm).

### Usage

To archive data persistently through Object Storage, prepare the following prerequisites in the Kubernetes cluster:

* Create a bucket in the Object Storage. Each cloud provider has a different methods. The steps below follow Azure Kubernetes Service.
* Create and use a volume with Azure Blob storage in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) [Storing data on AKS Blob Object Storage](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/azure-csi-blob-storage-provision?tabs=mount-nfs%2Csecret)
