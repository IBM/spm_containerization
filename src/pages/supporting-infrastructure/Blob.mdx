### What is Object Storage?

There are many options of Object Storages across Cloud providers that can be used to achieve persistent storage of the applications logs.

On Azure, an object storage can be obtained using Azure Blob Storage, which is configured within a Storage Account of type Premium.

While it shares many similarities with IBM Cloud Object Storage (COS) or Amazon AWS S3 (S3), it doesn't provide an interface to support the S3FS protocol, so Minio MC can not be used.

For more information about Azure Blob Storage, see [Azure Blob Storage](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/azure-blob-csi?tabs=Blobfuse).

### Usage

To archive data persistently through Azure Blob Storage, prepare the following prerequisites in the Kubernetes or OpenShift cluster and in your Azure subscription:

* Create a storage account of type Premium
* Within the storage account, create a Azure Blob Storage instance, and take note of the name as "AccountName"
* In the Azure Blob Storage instance, in the Access Keys section, create a new key, and take note of the name as "AccountKey"
* Navigate to the Azure Blob Storage instance, create a container, and take note of the name as "blob-container"
* Encode the values of "AccountName" and "AccountKey" in Base64 and add the following section to your override.values.yaml file with the correct values inputted

```yaml path=override-values.yaml
