## SPM Kubernetes cluster - Reference Architecture

The deployment architecture overview in this section represents how Merative Social Program Management (SPM) should be deployed into AKS.
This architecture allows SPM to leverage the benefits of flexibility, elasticity, efficiency and the strategic value offered by cloud native architecture.

* SPM deployed in WebSphere Liberty, lightweight JavaEE application server, designed for Kubernetes.
* EAR files deployed in their own Liberty instance.
* Liberty instances packaged in Docker images, which are run as Docker containers.
* Batch packaged as Docker images, which are run as containers.
* XML Server packaged as Docker images, which are run as containers.
* SPM only supports SPM Docker containers when deployed into Kubernetes pods.
* Deployment of the database is supported on bare metal and VMs when the application tier is running in Kubernetes.
* JMS messaging engine deployed separately using IBM MQ, managed through Helm Charts.
* SPM only supports IBM MQ Long Term Support (LTS) releases running on bare metal and VMs. (MQ CD releases are only supported in OpenShift containers.)
* Keep the database and queue manager tiers close to the application tier to reduce latency.
