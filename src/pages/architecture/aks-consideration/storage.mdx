## Storage

Before you get started with provisioning storage, it is important to understand the Kubernetes concepts of a `PersistentVolume` (PV) and a `PersistentVolumeClaim` (PVC) and how they work together in a cluster.

Information for this can be found here at [Understanding Kubernetes storage basics](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/concepts-storage) on the Azure site.
