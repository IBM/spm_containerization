## Container Registry

In [Azure Container Registry](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/container-registry) you can store and distribute container images in a fully managed private registry.

Push private images to conveniently run them in the Kubernetes Service and other runtime environments. Images are checked for security issues so that you can make informed decisions about your deployments.

An alternative to Azure container registry is [Artifactory Container Registry](https://jfrog.com/container-registry/), which can also be used to store and distribute container images in a fully managed private registry.
